# Mighty Net MTDuino Family

## MTDuino-SFM2CWW001 : Arduino and SigFox connectivity module

The  MTDuino-SFM2CWW001  represents  a  simple,  yet  powerful,  32-bit  extension  of  the  Arduino  UNO  platform. The board is powered by Atmel’s SAMD21 MCU, featuring a 32-bit ARM Cortex® MTDuino-SFM2CWW001 core.  With  the  addition  of  the  MTDuino-SFM2CWW001  board,  the  Arduino  family  becomes  larger  with  a  new  member providing increased performance. The power of its Atmel’s core gives this board an upgraded flexibility and boosts the scope of projects one can think of and make; moreover, it makes the MTDuino-SFM2CWW001 the ideal educational tool for learning about 32-bit application development
